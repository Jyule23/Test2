                        <p>begoma come from japan they are small metal half spheres that you rap in a cord and pull to launch them into the stadium, you do this to start the game, the goal of 
                           the game is to either spin the longest or knock your opponent out of the arena begoma were very basic being small metal tops there wasnt much to do with them 
                           but the product beyblade changed this.

                        <p>Plastic generation Beyblade better known as the Original series they were the first beyblades ever they were entierly made of plastic except for the weight the 4 components were the bit chip, the attack ring, the weight disc and the blade base they also had four sub systems the Magnacore,Engine Gear and the Hard/Heavy Metal System
                            they worked like this you had four types attack, defense, stamina and balance you used a launcher made for the beyblade and launced them in the stadium and either tired to spin longer or knock your oppenent out

                        <p>The Metal/hybrid wheel system was relesed in 2008 in japan under the name metal fight a sub-system the hybrid wheel system was relesed in 2009 in japan and was 
                           imported in 2010 by hasbro the main difference of the two series is that the sub-series added a new piece the energy ring/clear ring and metal/fusion wheel
                           this was done to prevent the launcher from breaking then the 4d system was introduced in 2011

                        <p>when beyblade burst first released it was very simmilar in size to a metal fight beyblade bust there was one big difference the burst beys could break into three
                           pieces and be put back togther these pieces were the layer disc and driver each piece was differnt and caused the bey to act different these picees were also able tp be changed out at anytime
                           a year later they introduced a new mechanich dual layers which introduced the a new layer system where the beyblades had 2 layers of plastic, after this
                           there was the god layers this series added a gimic to each layer like a bound blade or metal on the layer.

                        <p>after the sucsess of the first 3 burst series the company takara tomy decide to change them again by introducing the cho-z(super-z) layer system
                            with this system each layer had metal and some still had gimics like burst locks afterthe cho-z system had its run they decided to change the layers
                            intierly unlike the three series before GT the layers are 2 seperate pieces the gatinko chip and the layer and in the layer you can add a weight 
                            most weights are there to make the layer hevier but some add burst resistence

                        <p> after the GT system it was decided that keeping the chip and layer system was the right idea so when sparking came out they added a new mechanic 
                            chasies they are armor you put on your beyblade and beyblades still have gimics. after sparking there wasa DB in this series the layer has an extra
                            piece armor the armor allows the beyblade to change from low mode to high mode also the chips are now DB cores and some cores have gimics like burst stoppers
                            and a piece that moves into the air
